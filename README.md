# MP4-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of Machine Projecct 4, 2D, for the 2018 spring semester of CS 125, Introduction to Computer Science, at the University of Illinois.
The goal of this project was to understand how to work with two-dimensional arrays. Therefore the assignment mainly consisted of performing transformations on two-dimensional JavaScript arrays.
